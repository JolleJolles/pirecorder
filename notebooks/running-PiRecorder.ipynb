With a fast enough shutterspeed it is possible to record multiple images per second, but depends on the model of raspberry pi you use. Also, when a delay is provided that is less than ~x5 the shutterspeed, the camera processing time will take more time than the provided imgwait parameter and so images are taken immediately one after the other.
